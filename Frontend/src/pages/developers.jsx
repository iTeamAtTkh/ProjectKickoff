        <p>Hello  my story in web development starts with tkh as I had never really herd or understood of web development before tkh.TKH has been instrumental in my growth as a developer by providing hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, helping me build strong foundational skills in web development. Through JavaScript projects, I’ve learned how to make interactive and dynamic applications, while React has taught me how to structure scalable front-end interfaces efficiently. Working with Node.js has introduced me to server-side programming and backend integration, giving me a full understanding of how web applications operate end-to-end. TKH’s project-based approach has encouraged me to solve real-world problems, collaborate in teams, and develop critical coding and problem-solving skills. Overall, this journey has been shaping me steadily into a confident full-stack developer ready to tackle complex applications</p>
